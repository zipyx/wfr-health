# Workout Fitness Routine (WFR)

A program inspired by `Peter Attia's` methods for maximizing longevity

## Important Information

There are 4 important components to maximizing longevity according to research done by Attia. They are the following:

| Important Training Components |
| ----------------------------- |
| Zone 2                        |
| Zone 5 (VO2 max)              |
| Strength training             |
| Stability training            |

With the above mentioned components. `Zone 5` and `Strength training` will always be accompanied with `Zone 2` training. We will always do `Zone 2` exercises at the start of a session before doing `Zone 5` or `Strength traning`.

## Zone 2 Training

`Zone 2` measures the efficiency of our engine and we exercise to improve it (more efficient `mitochondria`, a hallmark of good metabolic health), this is usually be measured by a lactate meter by pricking our finger with a device. Our aim here is to `keep our reading meter under 2 mmol / L`. If we don't have
a device to use. Then we measure an approximation method by doing any of the below exercises or `aerobic exercises at a conversational pace`. Meaning, I should be talk and have a conversation whilst
still doing the exercise for the entire session. If I'm unable to talk, then I'm going to intense, so generally I should be able to exercise without lessening the intensity too much but keeping my heart rate good enough at a consistent level to exercise and talk.

- Running
- Rowing
- Cycling
- Rucking
- etc

### Time

| Recommended Session (weekly) | Time           |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- |
| `4 x sessions`               | `45 mins` each |

## Zone 5 Training

This type of training is anaerobic and involves the exercises mentioned in `Zone 2` just at an intense pace (without oxygen). This type of traning is to increase the size of our engine and take in more. `VO2 Max`.

The benefits of this training reduces your risk of `ACM` (all cause mortality) by `5 times`. Meaning you are `5 times` less likely to die in all areas.

### Time

| Recommended Session (weekly) | Time           |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- |
| `1 x session`                | `30 mins` each |

## Strength Training

This type of training can be any type of strength exercise but generally should be focused towards increasing strength around your grip. Some of which may include

- Deadlift exercises
- Dumbells exercises
- Bench press
- Pull ups
- Bicep / Triceps workouts
- Grip type exercises

Strength exercises may be good to be done in the morning, but will vary from person to person and what their needs are.

### Time

| Recommended Session (weekly) | Time                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `4 x sessions`               | `40 - 60 mins` each |

## Stability Training

This type of training is recommended to be DNS (dynamic neuromuscular stabilization) guided by a DNS expert. If not, in general any of the

- `PAILS` : Progressive Angular Isometric Loading
- `RAILS` : Regressive Angular Isometric Loading
- `FRC` : Functional Range Conditioning

Yoga, Pilates, Mobility traning etc.

### Time

| Recommended Session (weekly) | Time             |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `1 - 3 x sessions`           | `45 mins - 1 hr` |
